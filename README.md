# Sorting and Searching Algorithms Visualizer

A web application built with **Django** that helps visualize and understand various sorting and searching algorithms through interactive animations and step-by-step explanations.

---

## Features

- Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort

- Visualize searching algorithms such as:
  - Linear Search
  - Binary Search

- Step-by-step animation with controls to play, pause, and step through the algorithms.
- User-friendly interface built with Django templates and JavaScript for interactive visualizations.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices.
